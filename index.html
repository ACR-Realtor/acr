          professional real estate agent with Century 21 S.G.R. He was born and raised in Chicago, and he obtained knowledge and insights of neighborhoods and surrounding suburbs. Prior to real estate, Alberto was a crypto investor. Investing has
          helped
          him understand economic concepts such as scarcity and supply and demand. Alberto knows that the real estate market is aggressive and always in demand. His negotiation skills have helped him get great deals. He has devoted his life to real
          estate
          after having a bad experience with a broker. His ambition is to stand out from other agents by making sure his clients’ goals are met, regardless of price, location, and brokerage. Alberto is honest and loyal to his clients, and commissions
          will
          not influence his decisions. He exceptionally understands the rules and regulations a realtor must follow; therefore, he is here to act in his clients’ best interests, and he will succeed with efficiency and diligence.
